# ssh-sentinel-server

A simple to use and deploy SSH CA server.

**This is a Work In Progress** - the project is in its early days and is not ready to use anywhere.

Once ready, I will update the README and provide some more info in terms of usage and deployment

## Goals

There are a couple of SSH CA servers out there - I have found them all difficult to use and have specific platform
requirements. This projects aims to:

- Be simple to use and deploy
- Use sensible secure defaults
